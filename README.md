## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file based on the user's input

### User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository  
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions  
WHEN I enter my project title  
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README  
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions  
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests  
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options  
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under  
WHEN I enter my GitHub username  
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile  
WHEN I enter my email address  
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions  
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents  
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
